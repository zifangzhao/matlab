% surrogate_2d_3d
%
% This is the main program of the Iterative Amplitude Adapted Fourier
% Transform  (IAAFT) method to make surrogate fields. This version makes 3D
% fields based on the statistical properties of 2D fields. The amplitude distribution
% is supposed to be valid for the entire field (no vertical anisotropy).
%
% The IAAFT method was developped by Schreiber and Schmitz (see e.g. Phys. 
% Rev Lett. 77, pp. 635-, 1996) for statistical non-linearity tests for time series.
% This method makes fields that have a specified amplitude distribution and
% power spectral coefficients. It works by iteratively adaptation the amplitude 
% distribution and the Fourier coefficients (the phases are not changed in this 
% step). Do not use this program without understanding the function
% iaaft_loop_2d_horizontal and tuning its variables to your needs.
